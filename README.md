I made this repository to learn golang, i lear best
by writing( i love write ) and explaining things etc....
I pretend explaining the basics and complex things of the  language 
I intend to learn as i detail and explain through this repository.
That is, i will learn along with those who are reading. I count on the help of the more 
experienced to make the code cleaner ( i try it for myself but i accept help )

# Suggestions and more...
Improvements are accepted, you can to do this in pull requests section
I accepted suggestions tricks and more...
# How run go?

We can run go using the following command: `go run nameofyourfile.go`.
After that you code run ( if there are no errors );

Example:
    `go run print.go`

Result:
        `Welcome to go!`


# You can make a executable program in go...

You can make a executable program for yours code using the
following command:
        go build nameofyourfile.go
    
And after that in your folder an executable file are created and you can run them
just calling in the command line:
        `print.exe`
        

# The print.go file

In this file we make the simple print in the command line.
We write "Welcome to go!"

We add to the top of file the following code:
    `package main`

!!TODO: Explain why write that line of code

!!TODO: Explain why write that line of code and why use ( or not ) the "fmt" to print


To do this we make the basics imports using:
    `import(
        "fmt"
    )`



# The folder "webserver"

This is a simple webserver, he render tree pages:

<li>

<li>
    form.html
</li>
<li>
    hello
</li>

If you complete the form and submit it, you can se the values in your log.


!!TODO: Explain the functions of the code detailed
